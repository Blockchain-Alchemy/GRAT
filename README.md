# GRAT

### **GRAT** is a full-featured IDE where you make [Tezos](https://Tezos.com/) Smart Contracts using visual blocks. 

## What is GRAT
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2120817/169377598-3e3e5c73-0e0e-4bff-a321-3302c5a5727a.png)
GRAT is an online IDE (Integrated Development Environment) meant to disrupt Web3. This is a major [Tezos](https://Tezos.com/) based project that allows developers of all ages and skill levels to participate in the blockchain ecosystem as smart contract builders. Smart contracts are the basis of Web3 and blockchain intearcation - GRAT simplifies smart contract development and makes it super inclusive.


## Origin Story
In 2022, a unique series of events lead to the birth of GRAT!

1. [Encode Club](https://Encode.club/) held a workshop in partnership with the [Tezos Foundation](https://Tezos.foundation/).
    - [Lex](https://github.com/Dreitser) of [Blockchain Alchemy](https://BlockAlc.com/) was inspired to start something truly massive and dirsuptive - creating a better future for all. 
2. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) - an open-source project from MIT has become the world’s largest coding community for children, it allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations.
    - Young people are the future. [Blockchain Alchemy](https://BlockAlc.com/) decided to invest in our future by building a tool that makes smart contract development accessible for all.

The name **GRAT** is based on the French verb for Scratch - **Gratter**. It combines the French origins of [Tezos](https://Tezos.com/) with the philosphy of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) to be an inclusive tool for all ages and skill levels.

**This is Arthur** 

Artrhur is a dog if you like dogs, or a cat if you like cats. As you build smart contracts in GRAT, Arthur gains XP, which can be used to purchase skins and accessories for Arthur.  Arthur adds gamification and guidance to GRAT. 


## Code Is Hard
Writing smart contract code the "old-fashioned" way is prohibitively complex and frustrating.

### Before GRAT:
- Errors from typos
- Syntax Errors
- Looking up Opeartions, Types & Variables
- Steep Learning Curve
- Much Typing

### Now with GRAT:
- Code is free from typos
- Perfect Syntax
- Opeartions, Types & Variables all easily visable
- So Easy to Learn
- No Typing Required (not everybody can type)

## How Is It Built?

GRAT is an open-source project developed by [Blockchain Alchemy](https://BlockAlc.com/)

It incorporates Google's **Blockly** - an open source UI. [![Built on Blockly](https://tinyurl.com/built-on-blockly)](https://github.com/google/blockly)

It runs [Taqueria](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria) from [Taquito](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taquito) developers [ECAD Labs Inc](https://ecadlabs.com/) and [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/) - on the back-end server compile and deploy.

## What's Next

Grat is already so awesomem, but it can be even more Awesome!
There is still so much that needs to be done before we realease GRAT into the wild.

- [ ] Create **Tutorial**
- [ ] Build **Recipes** Library
- [ ] Add more medthods
- [ ] Add more variable types
- [ ] Add sp.failwith framework
- [ ] Build Out BigMap Opeartions
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Promotion
- [ ] Marketing
- [ ] Press Release and Educator Packet
- [ ] Release into the wild :tada:
