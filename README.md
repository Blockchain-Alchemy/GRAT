# GRAT
Create SmartPy using interlocking blocks. 

# Origin Story
This project was inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
Scratch is the worldâ€™s largest coding community for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization.

Scratch promotes computational thinking and problem solving skills; creative teaching and learning; self-expression and collaboration; and equity in computing.

Scratch is always free and is available in more than 70 languages.

It combines the core values of Scratch and brings them to [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) 
Grat is from "gratter" - the french verb for scracth. It will allow cretors of all ages to create Tezos Smart Contracts with the same simple visual interface.
